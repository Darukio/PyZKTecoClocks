        Establishes a connection to a device, retrieves its connection information, 
        and updates the connection status.

        Args:
            device (Device): The device object containing information such as IP, 
                             communication type, and model name.

        Raises:
            ConnectionFailedError: If the connection to the device fails due to a 
                                   network error.
            BaseError: If any other unexpected exception occurs during the process.

        Workflow:
            1. Initializes a connection manager for the device using its IP and 
               communication type.
            2. Attempts to connect to the device with retries.
            3. Pings the device to verify connectivity.
            4. If the ping is successful, retrieves device information and updates 
               the connection info.
            5. If the ping fails or a network error occurs, marks the connection 
               as failed and raises a ConnectionFailedError.
            6. Updates the shared connection information dictionary with the 
               device's connection status.
            7. Ensures the connection is properly disconnected in the `finally` block.
            8. Updates the progress tracker and logs the completion of the process.

        Note:
            This method uses a lock to ensure thread-safe updates to the shared 
            `connections_info` dictionary.
